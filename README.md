# PegglePatch

Simple program that applies the following patches to a Peggle executable:
* Restores the 2 unused level songs (8-Pegg and Unicorn-Type Beat)
* Removes the partner.xml signature check
* Removes the very outdated video card checks (fixes the "3D Acceleration not supported" issue)

To use, simply drag Peggle.exe onto the program. It'll created a patched executable named Peggle-Patched in the same directory.
